# weather-e-ink-display

Idea is ripped off from the blog post here: https://kimmo.blog/posts/7-building-eink-weather-display-for-our-home/

Assets shamelessly stolen from his github repo for the project here: https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/eink-weather-display

## Running locally

Running `boot dev` from the project root will start an auto-reloading server on `localhost:3000`.

After the server has started, a repl can be attached by running `boot repl -c` from another terminal in the project root, then `(start-repl)` from the prompt.
